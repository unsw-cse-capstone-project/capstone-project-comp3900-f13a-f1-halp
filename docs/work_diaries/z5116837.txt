Week 1
Friday
Formed group. Formed with Yubai, Jiayi, Roy and me. During the lab we selected to go for OnlinePropertySales. We set up github and Jira for coding. A group on Teams as well as Facebook was created for official and informal meetings. We were to go through the assignment spec sheet to prepare for Tuesday's meeting.

Week 2
Tuesday
A draft version of user case stories was developed that would be used as the base of the Jira backlog. Scrum master will upload the user stories onto Jira. Other members were to further investiage on software similar to OnlinePropertySales and begin the formation of storyboards. We have decided that we will implement the backend app by python with flask. No confirmation has been decided on front end.

Week 2
Friday
Continuation of discussion for the storyboard. Discussions about how sellers and headers were esablished in the meeting. Each member were to continue on with the planning of storyboards for the next meeting.

Week 2
Weekend
Yubai had to drop the course due to conflicts with his scheduling. A reduced scope was offerred to us by the lecturer if no other team member was found.

Week 3
Tuesday
Attempts made to contact the suggested member, Yiwei Ma, have been unsuccessful. No repsonse on emails were received and no social media connections could be established to get in touch with them. Under the assumption that there were only gonig to be three members in the group, we decided to work on a reduced scope. Sprints were reorganised with the new reduced scope. Setting up of base files are to be made to prepare for our first sprint.
